'vcRslProgramExecutor executes simple motion and control sequences of robots and manipulators.'
'RSL (Robot Sequence Language) consists of 3 levels: Program, Routine and a Statement. '
'It is simple and limited in the sense that it does not have any control statements such as if-then-else or for loops but because of the very same reason it is extremely easy to program―see RSL Program Executor.'
